✅ Replit Consignment App – Diagnostic Checklist: Account Creation & Role Access

Use this checklist to troubleshoot why new accounts cannot be created and data is not visible in the dashboard.

1. 🔐 AUTH FLOW

[ ] Are you distinguishing between "admin" and "consignor" login in the login controller?
[ ] On login, do you store the correct role in session: req.session.userType = "admin" or "consignor"?
[ ] On signup (setup-account), are new accounts saved to the **Customers** collection, not Users?

2. 📁 DATABASE STRUCTURE

[ ] Is the "Users" DB only storing admin accounts?
[ ] Is the "Customers" DB used for consignors only, and includes fields like:
    - id
    - name
    - email
    - passwordHash
    - consignedItems: []

[ ] Are you using consistent ID references (like customerId or email) when linking consigned items?

3. 🧾 ACCOUNT CREATION

[ ] Does the form at `/setup-account`:
    - Include all required fields (name, email, password)?
    - Hash the password before saving?
    - Save the new customer in the correct DB?
    - Redirect the user after creation?

[ ] Do you auto-log the customer in after signup?
    - Check req.session.customerId is set
    - Check req.session.userType = "consignor"

4. 🔄 DASHBOARD DATA FETCH

[ ] Does `/dashboard/:id` verify that the logged-in customer matches the ID in the URL?
[ ] Does it read from the **Customers** DB, not Users?
[ ] Does it pull `consignedItems` based on session or customerId?

5. 🚫 ACCESS CONTROL

[ ] Are you using `requireConsignor` middleware for dashboard routes?
[ ] Are customers prevented from accessing each other's dashboards?
[ ] Are admins blocked from accessing consignor-only routes?

6. ✅ SUGGESTED FIXES

[ ] Create a shared auth service to check role and user-type
[ ] Move all customer creation logic into a controller: `createCustomer()`
[ ] Log all session values after login/signup to confirm they're set correctly
[ ] Temporarily console.log user data fetched on dashboard load
